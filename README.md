# Reactions â‡’ Emissions = Remissions

A WIP project that brings both projects into the same repo, with the end goal of eventually allowing shared components.

## Goals

Based of the [universal-components-example](https://github.com/kkemple/universal-components-example) - I expect this to 
have three main folders:

* emission
* reaction
* components

Both emission and reaction will consume the components in some sense, either directly through file references
or through a third library that represents components for both. Ideally, we can get components from both into the same 
root folder, and we can find _some sense_ of connection between them all.
