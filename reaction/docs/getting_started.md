# How do I work in Reaction Force?

We're going to take a component, and make it fit inside Reaction Force. This doc is based 
on [this PR](https://github.com/artsy/reaction-force/pull/176).

## Simple

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react"

class IconImageSet extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <svg id="imageset" data-name="imageset" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 44 44">
        <path d="M6760.67,551.72h-32v-32h32v32Zm-30-2h28v-28h-28v28Z" transform="translate(-6728.67 -507.72)" />
        <polygon points="38 37 36 37 36 8 7 8 7 6 38 6 38 37" />
        <polygon points="44 31 42 31 42 2 13 2 13 0 44 0 44 31" />
      </svg>
    )
  }
}
export default IconImageSet
```

This is a component which returns an SVG. To move this into Reaction force, you'll need to find a place to put it. 

It should go somewhere inside `src/components/` - but it will need to be a `.tsx` file. So for now, let's imagine it is
in `src/components/icon/image_set.tsx`. Make the file and paste the contents in.

Doing this will cause a compiler error. Welcome to TypeScript-land.

```sh
class IconImageSet extends Component {
                              ~~~~~~~~~

src/components/icon/image_set.tsx(3,28): error TS2314: Generic type 'Component<P, S>' requires 2 type argument(s).
```

So, this is the major difference between TypeScript React, and JavaScript React. What this error tells you is that a 
React Component is a [generic class](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) in TypeScript. Simply put,
to create a component you _need_ to define the props and state for it in the declaration [via interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html).

An interface is a way of defining the shape of a JavaScript object. If you want to skip on this today, you can just 
change the code to be this: `class IconImageSet extends Component<any, any> {`. Which says `any` props, and `any` state.

If you do care about adding some of the types, we do this for better tooling and improved safety, this is a contrived 
example of defining your props and state:

```ts
interface Props {
  width: number
  height: number
  color: string
}

interface State {
  appliedColors: boolean
}

class IconImageSet extends Component<Props, State> {
```

If you don't have state at all, write `null` instead in the second argument: `Component<Props, null>`. That's your 
compiler errors sorted, so your component is working. Next, you want to preview it in Storybooks.

#### Storybooks

Reaction Force uses [React Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to let you work in a sandboxed environment for your component.
You're going to need to create a new file for your storybook section. We keep stories inside folders which are named `__stories__`. This folder exists in the same folder as the code they test. So make `/src/components/icon/__stories__` 
and add a file called  `icon_image_set.story.tsx`. Your story should be picked up automatically assuming it 
ends with `story.tsx`. 

A story section generally looks like this:

```tsx
import { storiesOf } from "@storybook/react"
import * as React from "react"

import IconImageSet from "../icon_image_set"

storiesOf("Icons", module)
  .add("Imageset Preview", () => <IconImageSet/>)
```

Where you can provide an outer name for the section (`"Icons"`), then a state for that component (`"Imageset Preview"`). 
As this component has no props, there's no need to test different props. However, you could easily see a more complex
example looking like:

```tsx
storiesOf("Icon", module)
  .add("Imageset Defaults", () => <IconImageSet/>)
  .add("Imageset Wide", () => <IconImageSet width={200}/>)
  .add("Imageset Red", () => <IconImageSet color="#bb1111"/>)
  // And so on
```

You can start up the storybooks server by following the README, and any time you press save in your editor you should 
get hot reloading of your changes.

So that's your dev environment. Let's look at testing.

#### Testing with Jest 

We write our tests in Jest, we also co-locate tests in the same folder structure as your code. Tests live inside a `__tests__`
folder, and need to have `.test.ts` inside the name. So in this case, the test file would be `src/components/icon/__tests__` 
and `icon_image_set.test.tsx`.

There are two main ways to write tests for your code in Reaction Force:

* [Jest Snapshots](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/snapshot-testing.html) as a way of ensuring any changes to 
our component trees are explicit. It provides a really easy way to "lock" a snapshot of a JSON object (like a rendered 
react tree) into the file-system. These snapshots are included in the git repo, and CI will compare that the same process
makes the same JSON object.

  Any individual story state is probably worth converting into a jest snapshot.

  ```js
  import * as React from "react"
  import * as renderer from "react-test-renderer"

  import IconImageSet from "../icon/image_set"

  it("renders properly", () => {
    const icon = renderer.create(<IconImageSet />).toJSON()
    expect(icon).toMatchSnapshot()
  })
  ```

* Behavior Testing, which are common unit tests. A react Component tends to be a class, so you can instantiate the class
and run expectations against that object. I'm going to include some tests from Emission as an example:

  ```tsx
  import Artist from "../artist"

  const emptyProps = { navigator: {} as any, route: {} as any }

  describe("callbacks", () => {
    it("calls pop when done is tapped", () => {
      const navigator: any = { pop: jest.fn() }
      const artist = new Artist({ navigator, route: {} })
      artist.doneTapped()
      expect(navigator.pop).toHaveBeenCalled()
    })

    it("calls nav.pop & updateWithResult when a result is tapped", () => {
      const navigator: any = { pop: jest.fn() }
      const updateWithResult = jest.fn()
      const artist = new Artist({ navigator, route: {}, updateWithResult })

      artist.artistSelected({} as any)

      expect(navigator.pop).toHaveBeenCalled()
      expect(updateWithResult).toHaveBeenCalled()
    })
  })

  describe("state", () => {
    it("is set up with empty state", () => {
      const artist = new Artist(emptyProps)
      expect(artist.state).toEqual({ query: null, searching: false, results: null })
    })

    it("sets new state when text is changed", () => {
      const artist = new Artist(emptyProps)
      artist.setState = jest.fn()
      artist.searchForQuery = jest.fn()

      artist.textChanged("Blu")

      expect(artist.setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ query: "Blu", searching: true })
      expect(artist.searchForQuery).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Blu")
    })
  })
  ```
 
  There are a lot of techniques being used here:

  * Telling TypeScript you don't care about the types for an object by using `as any` and `: any`.
  * Using `jest.fn()` to create a mock function, then checking what calls it via `toHaveBeenCalledWith` or `toHaveBeenCalled`.

You can run tests via `yarn jest`, jest has an awesome watcher mode via ` yarn jest -- --watch` which will run all tests 
when you press save.

# Relay?

Optional. If you want to re-use component which use Relay internally, you'll see that the files export both the `Relay.Container` and
and normal React component. You can re-use the component by using `import { ComponentName } from "./component"` instead of
the default return which is a Relay'd version. This only works for the leaf node in a Relay component tree though.
