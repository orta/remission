### Using this repo with VS Code

This repo comes with the usual recommendations around linters, test runners etc.

One unexpected thing this repo has set up is the ability to do inline debugging with Chrome. As long as you have all the recommended extensions installed, you can hit "Start Debugging" any time.

This will open a new Chrome tab which has a debugger attached to VS Code. You will be able to inspect the objects from a GUI, and place breakpoints easily. If you'd like an to see what this looks like in practice, check out the [discussion in #23](https://github.com/artsy/reaction-force/pull/23).
