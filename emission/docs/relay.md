### Using Relay

Some helpful Relay documentation is listed below, but the general workflow is:

1. Build a fragment for each child component that specifies only the attributes used by the component itself (no
   extraneous information).
2. Ensure the parent component calls `getFragment` for each child component that uses Relay.
3. Make sure to supply every child componentâ€™s `props` upon instantiation in the parent.

To update the `RelayProps` after modifying the GraphQL fragment, run the following command:

```sh
yarn relay2ts -- path/to/file.tsx --update
```

----

Another gotcha is around fragments that use variables. For this it is important to understand that whenever a Relay
backed hierarchy is used, 2 trees will be rendered.

1. A tree of all Relay query fragments is rendered into a single query.
2. Once the query has been performed, the view component tree is rendered.

What this means in practice, is that you will need to pass variables down _both_ those trees.
1. Once from the [Relay route](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/api-reference-relay-route.html) down through all
   `getFragment(name, variables)` calls.
2. Second down through the props of all components.
